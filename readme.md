## üì¶ Monorepo Packages
decast-did-resolver
`did:decast` is a custom DID method that uniquely represents a user within the Decast ecosystem. It complies with the [W3C DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and provides:

- Cryptographic key association (Ed25519 by default)
- Public verification methods
- Authentication support (JWT, DIDComm, etc.)
- Optional service endpoints (profile, storages, etc.)

A custom DID resolver for the did:decast method. It enables DID Document resolution from our registry.

### did-manager

The did-manager is a browser extension for Chrome that allows users to manage their decentralized identities using the custom DID method did:decast:publicKey. It serves as a secure wallet for Decast identities, enabling key management and secure DID-based authentication.

#### üîê Features

* Generate new identities based on Ed25519 key pairs.

* Restore identity using a private key (manual input or paste).

* Remove identities from local storage.

* Export private key securely for user backup.

*  Multiple identity support: switch between multiple DID profiles.

### üßæ Signing Workflow

The extension also acts as a signer for authentication flows:

1. A verifier (e.g., Decast or did-front) sends a signing request to the extension, including a nonce and request metadata.

2. The extension shows a UI prompt asking the user to review and confirm the nonce.

3. If the user approves, the message is signed using the selected private key.

4. The extension returns the signature, nonce, and associated did:decast back to the requesting origin.

This flow is used to:

* Log the user into Decast

* Authorize verifiable credential issuance

* Provide proof of key ownership

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description | Default Value | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth Client ID for authentication | `1054183103777-7eqm2ddpdo6ok9b1cq4c350132mmiusr.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Yes |
| `DID_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the DID service | `https://did.decast.live` | Yes |
| `DID_RESOLVER_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the DID resolver service | `https://did.decast.live/api/v1/dids/resolver` | Yes |
| `EXTENSION_ID` | Extension ID for the DID Manager browser extension | `algkhhfaciplhfnkmecpmdfampkppndj` | Yes |

| `HOST` | Host address for the web application | `0.0.0.0` | No |
| `PORT` | Port for the web application | `8080` | No |

### Using Environment Variables

#### With pnpm (Local Development)

1. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   # In the root directory
   cp env-example .env
   
   # Or in the did-web package
   cp env-example packages/did-web/.env
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Environment variables are automatically loaded** by Nuxt.js from the `.env` file.

#### With Docker

1. **Method 1: Using .env file** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Copy example and update values
   cp env-example .env
   
   # Start containers (Docker Compose automatically loads .env)
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Method 2: Using environment variables directly**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
   export DID_BASE_URL="https://your-did-service.com"
   export EXTENSION_ID="your_extension_id"
   
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Method 3: Using docker-compose override**:
   ```bash
   # Create docker-compose.override.yml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     did-web:
       environment:
         - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
         - DID_BASE_URL=https://your-did-service.com
         - EXTENSION_ID=your_extension_id
   ```

#### Environment File Locations

- **Root level**: `.env` (loaded by Docker Compose)
- **did-web package**: `packages/did-web/.env` (loaded by Nuxt.js)
- **Example file**: `env-example` (template for setup)

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Use different values** for development, staging, and production
3. **Rotate sensitive values** regularly
4. **Use secrets management** in production environments
5. **Validate environment variables** at startup

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Environment variables not loading**:
   ```bash
   # Check if .env file exists
   ls -la .env
   
   # Verify Docker Compose is loading the file
   docker-compose config
   ```

2. **Nuxt.js not reading environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env is in the correct location
   ls -la packages/did-web/.env
   
   # Check Nuxt configuration
   cat packages/did-web/nuxt.config.ts
   ```

3. **Docker containers not using updated environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Rebuild containers after changing .env
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

## üìä Ports

- **did-web**: 3000 (HTTP)
- **did-manager**: 8080 (Extension builder)
- **did-resolver**: 3001 (Package service)

## üîí Security

# Decast DID Verifications

Decast DID Verification is a decentralized identity (DID) proof system designed for use within the [Decast.live](https://decast.live) platform. It enables verifiers (such as Decast.live) to request specific identity credentials from users in a secure, privacy-preserving, and decentralized way using verifiable credentials and DID-based JWT proofs.

---

## üìå Overview

This module facilitates:
- Requesting verification from users via DID.
- Securely presenting only the required fields (`credentialSubject`) defined by the credential schema.
- Generating a verifiable proof (DID-JWT) and redirecting it to the verifier.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Usage

1. **Verifier (e.g., Decast.live)** initiates a verification request with:
   - A **credential schema** that defines the structure of the credential.
   - A list of requested **credentialSubject fields** (e.g., `firstName`, `age`, `verifiedDate`).
   - Its own **verifier address**.

2. **did-front** (Decast DID Frontend):
   - Receives the verification query.
   - Prompts the user to log in via:
     - Metamask (wallet-based DID)
     - Decast native DID
   - Displays the request details:
     - Requested credentialSubject fields
     - Verifier information (e.g., `Decast.live`)

3. After login:
   - The app checks if the authenticated DID has a valid credential that matches the requested schema and `credentialSubject` fields.
   - If a matching credential is found:
     - The user is prompted to **generate a verifiable proof** (DID-JWT).
     - The app redirects the user back to the **verifier** (e.g., Decast.live) with the signed proof.
   - If no matching credential exists:
     - The user is directed to **complete the verification process** with the appropriate **credential issuer service** for the schema.
