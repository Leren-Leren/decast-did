# @decast/did-resolver

This is a DID Resolver implementation for the `did:decast` method. It allows you to resolve `did:decast:*` identifiers into W3C-compliant DID Documents.

## üÜî What is `did:decast`?

`did:decast` is a custom DID method that uniquely represents a user within the Decast ecosystem. It complies with the [W3C DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and provides:

- Cryptographic key association (Ed25519 by default)
- Public verification methods
- Authentication support (JWT, DIDComm, etc.)
- Optional service endpoints (profile, storages, etc.)


## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @decast/decast-did-resolver
# or
pnpm add @decast/decast-did-resolver
```

## üß© Usage

### With `did-resolver` from `decast-did-resolver` package

```ts
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver';
import { getDecastResolver } from '@decast/decast-did-resolver';

const resolver = new Resolver({
  ...getDecastResolver()
});

const didDocument = await resolver.resolve('did:decast:abc123');
console.log(didDocument);
```

### Directly

```ts
import { getDecastResolver } from '@decast/decast-did-resolver';

const doc = await resolveDID('did:decast:abc123');
console.log(doc);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
pnpm install
```
